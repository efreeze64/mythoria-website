        ( I used to look out at a kingdom that was so divine ) <br />
        (With precious resources and people kind in heart ) <br />
        Advanced technology of great power <br />
        Gods blessed us and we praised them high
      </p>
      <p className="header">PRE-CHORUS</p>
      <p className="text">But in our greedy hearts, lies a fate so dark </p>
      <p className="header">CHORUS</p>
      <p className="text">
        In the ocean deep A buried history <br />
        Dive into the sea <br />
        Search and you will find <br />
        The fate of my kind <br />
        Gone for all eternity

        In the ocean deep <br />
        Our buried history

      <p className="header">VERSE 2</p>
      <p className="text">
        As time flew by, man turned blind <br />
        to the reality of what was taking place <br />
        Greed for might, rose to mind <br />
        And soon a fight for great might <br />
        The gods gazed on us <br />
        Told us to immediately cease <br />
        But it was too late they, determined our fate <br />
        With a punishment that will show the whole world <br />
      </p>
      <p className="header">PRE-CHORUS</p>
      <p className="text">
        That greed is a sin, our reckoning <br />
        Broke us apart to teach us a lesson <br />
        Now our fate lies <br />
      </p>
      <p className="header">CHORUS</p>
      <p className="text">
        In the ocean deep A buried history <br />
        Dive into the sea <br />
        Search and you will find <br />
        The fate of my kind <br />
        Gone for all eternity
      </p>
      <p className="header">INTERLUDE</p>
      <p className="text">
        A buried history <br />
        for all eternity
      </p>
      <p className="header">BREAKDOWN</p>
      <p className="text">
        The ground was shaking, <br />
        the tides were raging <br />
        The land was sinking down <br /> <br />
        Embrace the destruction - our doom
      </p>
      <p className="header">VERSE 3</p>
      <p className="text">
        Wrath <br />
        Greed <br />
        Envy <br />
        Density of sin <br /> <br />
        Destroyed in a single night <br />
        Swallowed by the tides, never to be found <br />
        The tale is told, mouth to mouth <br />
        About a beautiful place, where water surrounds <br />
        no one knows where itâ€™s hidden <br />
        And no one knows what really happened.
      </p>
      <p className="header">PRE-CHORUS</p>
      <p className="text">
        So hear my tale, of my land <br />
        Its fate still lies this day <br />
      </p>
      <p className="header">CHORUS</p>
      <p className="text">
        In the ocean deep A buried history <br />
        Dive into the sea <br />
        Search and you will find <br />
        The fate of my kind <br />
        Gone for all eternity
